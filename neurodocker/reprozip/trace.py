"""Minimize existing Docker container with ReproZip.

Project repository: https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/reprozip/

See https://github.com/freesurfer/freesurfer/issues/70 for an example of using
ReproZip to minimize Freesurfer's recon-all command.


Current implementation
----------------------
A bash script (utils/reprozip_trace_runner.sh) implements items 1-3 below.

1. Install a dedicated Miniconda with ReproZip (not added to $PATH).
2. Run `reprozip trace ...` on an arbitrary number of commands.
3. Pack the experiment (`reprozip pack ...`)
4. Copy the pack file onto the host (done with `docker-py`).
    - at this point, the user is free to do anything with the pack file.
    - QUESTION: should this implementation do anything with this pack file
                after it is copied onto the host? eg, `reprounzip-docker setup`

Potential implementations
-------------------------
See https://github.com/kaczmarj/neurodocker/issues/23#issuecomment-307863219.

Notes
-----
1. To use the reprozip trace within a Docker container, the image/container must
   be built/run with `--security-opt seccomp:unconfined`.
      A. `docker build` does not allow --security-opt seccomp:unconfined on
          macOS.
2. Docker's use of layers means that even if a smaller container is committed
   from a larger image there will be no reduction in size (the previous layers
   are preserved). There is a `--squash` option in `docker build` that will
   merge all layers at the end of the build and remove files that were deleted
   in previous layers.
      A. The `--squash` option is experimental and might be changed or removed
         in the future.
      B. See https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/332
      C. See https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/22641
