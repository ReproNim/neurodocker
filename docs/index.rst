Welcome to Neurodocker!
=======================

*Neurodocker* is a command-line program that generates custom Dockerfiles and Singularity
recipes for neuroimaging and minifies existing containers. Its purpose is to make it
easier for scientists (and others) to easily create reproducible computational environments.

This website is in progress. Is there is something you would like to see here, please
`submit a new GitHub issue <https://github.com/ReproNim/neurodocker/issues/new>`_.
